HTML Email Production Assignment:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Produce an HTML version of the file "html-email-example.png" suitable for use as an HTML
email.  All the artwork assets are included in this folder.  There is also a starter file
"index.html" that contains a link tag to the fonts needed and also the URLs for the links
to use for the call to action buttons.

Do not add any style tags or any more CSS to the head of the template page.  All the 
styling should be inline in the HTML.  Leave the max-width: 590px in place for the 
wrapper.

A good result should match the original PNG mockup as well as possible.  It does not need
to be pixel-accurate, but it should reproduce the artwork faithfully.

The result will only be viewed by dragging the HTML file onto Google Chrome - don't worry 
about nuance with other browsers or actually sending it out and viewing it via an email 
client.
